			> (I don't know anything about blacklisting or detaching!) 

			The problem is the Linux kernel DVB driver is loaded, which means it is 
			making the device available for TV reception.  Since the device is in 
			use by this driver, the SDR programs can't access it.

			As the message suggests, there are two solutions.  The quickest is to 
			simply unload the driver: 

			  sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2832 

			Not sure whether "rtl2832" on the end there is required or not, but it 
			can't hurt.  This is only a temporary solution, as the driver will be 
			loaded again the next time you unplug and replug the USB device, so 
			you'll have to run the command again. 

			If this works, and you don't want to use the device for TV reception, 
			you can stop the module from ever being loaded, solving the problem 
			permanently.  The exact method depends on your Linux distribution, but 
			for me (running Arch Linux) I create a file in /etc/modprobe.d with 
			a .conf extension (I called it "no-rtl.conf") with these contents: 

			  blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu 
			  blacklist rtl2832 
			  blacklist rtl2830 

			Again not sure whether it's necessary to blacklist all three of these 
			or just the first, but I was erring on the side of caution and chose to 
			list everything to do with the Realtek DVB device. 

			Once you have created this blacklist file, you may need to unload the 
			driver one last time if it was already running - the blacklist 
			prevents it from loading but doesn't do anything if it's already 
			running. 

			The second solution is to recompile the rtl_test program, and include 
			support for asking the kernel driver to let go of the device, so it can 
			be accessed.  This may not be ideal though, because you will still have 
			the problem of the device being in use if you use other programs that do 
			not support detaching of the kernel driver. 

			If you're only interested in SDR use, blacklisting is the way to go. 
			And you can always remove the blacklist if you do want to use it for 
			TV one day. 

			Cheers, 
			Adam.
